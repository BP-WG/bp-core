//! Core module defines core strict interfaces from informational LNPBP
//! standards specifying secure and robust practices for function calls
//! used in main bitcoin protocols:
//! - consensus-level primitives;
//! - deterministic bitcoin commitments;
//! - single-use-seals.
//!
//! The goal of this module is to maximally reduce the probability of errors and
//! mistakes within particular implementations of this paradigms by
//! standardizing typical workflow processes in a form of interfaces that
//! will be nearly impossible to use in the wrong form.
